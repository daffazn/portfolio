# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains individual projects that demonstrate my ability to use various tools and programming languages for data analysis. Most of these projects have the process of data extraction, wrangling, cleaning, manipulation, exploration, and visualization. This repository will continue to be updated over time, either by adding a new project or by updating the existing project.

I use Jupyter Notebook to show my work, except for the project that uses Tableau.

**More details of each project are in each repository.**

## Google Play Store Market Analysis (Python)
•	Using a Kaggle’s dataset that consists of public metrics of the 10,000+ apps from Google Play Store<br>
•	Conducting data cleaning and data wrangling using NumPy and Pandas to get a more accurate analysis<br>
•	Performing univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn to find insights<br>

## European Soccer Analysis (SQL)
•	Using a Kaggle’s dataset that consists of details related to 25,000+ European Soccer matches<br>
•	Preparing the data and migrate it to the PostgreSQL database using Python’s SQLAlchemy<br>
•	Conducting different kinds of SQL queries to demonstrate ways to get insights and answer questions<br>

## Historical Airplane Accident Analysis (Python)
•	Web scraping 5,000+ data about historical airplane accidents from multiple web pages<br>
•	Wrangling and manipulating the data using NumPy and Pandas to get a more accurate analysis<br>
•	Conducting data exploration to find insights and doing simple visualization using Matplotlib<br>

## COVID-19 Data Dashboard (Tableau)
•	Using a dataset from data.world that consists of 100,000+ data of daily pandemic information in every country<br>
•	Connecting Tableau’s workbook to the data.world using Web Data Connector to get real-time data<br>
•	Making a Tableau dashboard containing interactive visualizations like density map, time-series plot, bar, etc<br>

## Twitter Keyword Analysis (Python)
•	Extracting 300,000+ tweets containing a keyword using a modified library to access the Twitter API v2<br>
•	Using time distribution and words frequency analysis to find insights about reactions caused by an event<br>
•	Performing simple sentiment analysis for every data to determine its positive or negative polarity<br>

## Police Activity Analysis (Python)
•	Using a Stanford Open Policing dataset that consists of 500,000+ traffic stops details conducted by the police<br>
•	Doing simple exploratory data analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib to answer some questions<br>
