# Police Activity Analysis

I used Stanford Open Policing dataset that consists of 500,000+ traffic stops details conducted by the police in State of Rhode Island in the US. I use Python with the help of NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries to do all the work.

Dataset: https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/ (RI, csv)
