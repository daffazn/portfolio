# European Soccer Analysis

I used a Kaggle’s dataset that consists of 25,000+ match details of European soccer leagues and other things related to it, from 2008 season until 2016. The data originally is in the form of an SQLite file (.sqlite). I migrated it to PostgreSQL database using Python’s SQLAlchemy and prepared the data using Pandas. Then I made the queries in PostgreSQL dialect. I also utilize Python so I can show the query results in Jupyter Notebook.
